We added support for configuring MS Teams webhooks to receive alerts and notifications from Hive.

![MS Teams Webhook dialog](/changelog/2024-06-14-ms-teams-webhooks-alerts/project-msteams-alert-full.png)

Before you can start receiving alerts and notifications in MS Teams, you need to configure the
webhook in the project settings. To do this, navigate to the project settings and click on the
**Alerts** tab. In the **Alerts** section, click on the **Add channel** button and select **MS Teams
Webhook** from the dropdown menu. Enter the webhook URL in `Endpoint` field and click **Save**. Then
you can create an alert that will be triggered when schema change is detected upon publish.
Documentation for this feature is available [here](/docs/management/organizations#ms-teams-webhook).
